    <h2>Community-focused snow coverage</h2>
    <p>
      Altgeld Gardens spans wide residential courts and pedestrian paths that require coordinated snow removal. We map each court
      to assign the right equipmentâ€”compact plows for drive lanes and shovel teams for building entrances and stairwells.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crews also clear key connectors to 130th Street, Stony Island Avenue, and the Bishop Ford Expressway so residents can commute
      safely during winter storms.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Safe access for services and programs</h2>
    <p>
      We maintain access to community anchors including the Altgeld Gardens Library, Childcare Center, and the Carver Park campus.
      Salting and shoveling schedules are coordinated around food distribution times, after-school programs, and athletic events.
    </p>
    <p>
      Service logs help resident associations document compliance and secure funding for continued winter maintenance.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Monitoring challenging microclimates</h2>
    <p>
      The nearby Calumet River and wetlands can create dense fog and slick surfaces. We monitor local sensors and reapply de-icer
      when freezing rain or river moisture adds a glaze to sidewalks and ramps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seasonal clients receive updates via text or email, including photos if crews identify drainage issues or snow piles that
      need relocation.
