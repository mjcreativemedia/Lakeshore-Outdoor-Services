    <h2>North Shore crews ready for every storm</h2>
    <p>
      Wilmette’s lakefront exposure creates wind-driven snow drifts and icy spray along Sheridan Road and Lake Avenue. We monitor
      shoreline weather stations to time pre-salting and dispatch crews before morning commutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our teams maintain residences, condo associations, and downtown businesses near the Baha’i House of Worship, Gillson Park,
      and the Village Center.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Tailored equipment for varied properties</h2>
    <p>
      We pair truck plows and loaders for large estates with walk-behind blowers and shoveling teams for tight courtyard homes.
      Heated entry mats, gutters, and drainage points are inspected to prevent refreeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      For commercial properties, we coordinate with property managers to maintain parking lots, alley deliveries, and stairwells
      leading to offices and restaurants.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Detailed reporting keeps owners informed</h2>
    <p>
      After each event, clients receive a digital service log summarizing snowfall totals, start and end times, and materials used.
      Photos are available on request to document compliance for HOA boards and insurance carriers.
