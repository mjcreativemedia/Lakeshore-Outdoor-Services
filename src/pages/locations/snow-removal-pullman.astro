    <h2>Historic streets need careful handling</h2>
    <p>
      Pullman’s narrow brick streets and preserved homes require gentle snow removal. We use rubber-edged plows and compact
      equipment to avoid damaging masonry curbs or ornamental fencing near 111th Street and Cottage Grove Avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shovel teams clear gangways, back entrances, and stoops while applying pet-safe de-icers to protect landscaping. We also
      keep ADA ramps and boardwalks accessible for museum guests and residents alike.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Industrial and visitor facilities stay open</h2>
    <p>
      Beyond the residential core, Pullman includes active factories, distribution centers, and the Method manufacturing campus.
      We coordinate shift-based plowing to keep docks, loading zones, and employee parking lots clear before and after work hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Visitor-heavy weekends at the Pullman Visitor Center trigger additional sidewalk patrols and salting around interpretive
      exhibits, Market Hall vendors, and event spaces.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Proactive communication and reporting</h2>
    <p>
      Seasonal clients receive storm alerts, route ETAs, and completion notices via text or email. Service logs document snowfall,
      materials used, and any concerns we noticed, such as ice buildup near drainage grates or ruts in gravel parking areas.
