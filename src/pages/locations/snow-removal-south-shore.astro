    <h2>Focused coverage for South Shore streets</h2>
    <p>
      South Shore’s proximity to Lake Michigan means fast-moving lake-effect bands that drop heavy, wet snow on South Shore Drive,
      Jeffery Boulevard, and the residential streets feeding the Cultural Center and Rainbow Beach. We map each property to account
      for one-way traffic patterns, Metra Electric crossings, and school zones near Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Paideia Academy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crews use compact plow trucks for tight gangways and rear parking pads while shovel teams tackle stoops, walkways, and
      basement stairwells. De-icing materials are calibrated for historic limestone steps and church entrances along 75th Street
      to avoid surface damage.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Storm monitoring tailored to the lakefront</h2>
    <p>
      We monitor forecasts from the National Weather Service, shoreline temperature buoys, and live feeds from Midway Airport to
      anticipate sudden shifts in wind direction. When radar shows snow bands redeveloping over the lake, we dispatch additional
      crews from our Calumet staging yard to cover apartment towers near 71st Street and commercial corridors around Stony Island
      Avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seasonal contracts include pre-storm brining for long stretches of sidewalk near the South Shore Cultural Center and CPD
      District 3. After the initial push, supervisors revisit properties to clear municipal windrows and ensure fire hydrants and
      curb cuts remain visible for emergency vehicles.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Documentation for associations and small businesses</h2>
    <p>
      We deliver timestamped service logs after every visit, outlining snow totals, crew arrival and departure times, and the
      materials applied. Condominium boards along South Bennett Avenue and small business owners on 79th Street rely on those
      records to prove compliance with Chicago’s sidewalk clearing ordinance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Need flexible billing? We offer seasonal invoices, per-event pricing, and emergency rates so you can protect South Shore
      residents, congregations, and visitors without surprise costs.
