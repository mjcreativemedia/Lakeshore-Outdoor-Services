    <h2>Coverage tuned to Bronzeville’s grid</h2>
    <p>
      Bronzeville features narrow residential streets, historic greystones, and vibrant commercial corridors. We map alleys and
      garage entries between Cottage Grove Avenue and State Street to ensure plow trucks and shovel teams arrive without blocking
      traffic or CTA bus lanes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crews keep sidewalks open for visitors to the Bronzeville Children’s Museum, Gallery Guichard, and the Harold Washington
      Cultural Center. We also maintain parking lots for churches and community centers hosting food distribution and weekend
      programs.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Equipment sized for courtyards and alleys</h2>
    <p>
      Many Bronzeville properties rely on gated courtyards and shared driveways. We pair compact plow trucks with walk-behind snow
      blowers and shovel crews to clear areas that large city plows cannot reach. Crews document each visit with timestamps and
      before-and-after photos when requested.
    </p>
    <p>
      De-icing materials are tailored to protect the limestone steps and mosaic sidewalks common near historic row homes on
      Calumet Avenue. For business corridors, we pre-treat crosswalks and curb cuts to keep pedestrian flow moving during
      neighborhood events and farmers markets.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Storm monitoring and communication</h2>
    <p>
      Dispatchers monitor Midway Airport radar, lake-effect advisories, and CTA service alerts. You’ll receive text or email
      updates when crews depart, along with digital service logs after each pass. If municipal plows redeposit snow at the end of
      your block, we schedule a return visit to reopen parking and access lanes.
