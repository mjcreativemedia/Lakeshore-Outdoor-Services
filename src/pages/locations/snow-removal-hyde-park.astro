    <h2>South Side crews dedicated to Hyde Park</h2>
    <p>
      From tree-lined streets near the University of Chicago to lakefront high-rises, we tailor equipment and manpower for each
      property. Dispatchers coordinate timing around parking restrictions and special events to keep access open.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Plowing for alley garages, shared drives, and private lots</li>
      <li>Hand shoveling for brownstone steps, courtyards, and accessible entrances</li>
      <li>Pre- and post-storm de-icing to protect concrete, brick, and limestone walkways</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Hyde Park FAQs</h2>
    <details>
      <summary>Do you coordinate with property managers or facility teams?</summary>
      <p>
        Yes. We provide updates before, during, and after each storm so property teams can plan staffing, move vehicles, and
        maintain safe pedestrian paths.

    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Can you prioritize medical or academic facilities?</summary>
      <p>
        Absolutely. Let us know about critical entrances or loading docks so we can stage crews for continuous attention during
        active weather.
