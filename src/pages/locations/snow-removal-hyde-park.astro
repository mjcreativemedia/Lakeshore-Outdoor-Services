    <h2>South Side crews dedicated to Hyde Park</h2>
    <p>
      From tree-lined streets near the University of Chicago to lakefront high-rises, we tailor equipment and manpower for each
      property. Dispatchers coordinate timing around parking restrictions and special events to keep access open.

    <ul>
      <li>Plowing for alley garages, shared drives, and private lots</li>
      <li>Hand shoveling for brownstone steps, courtyards, and accessible entrances</li>
      <li>Pre- and post-storm de-icing to protect concrete, brick, and limestone walkways</li>
