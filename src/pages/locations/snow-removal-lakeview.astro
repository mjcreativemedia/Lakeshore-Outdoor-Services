    <h2>Lakeview snow crews on standby</h2>
    <p>
      We maintain townhouse alleys, condo entrances, and retail sidewalks along Belmont, Broadway, and Clark. Crews are familiar
      with meter parking restrictions and coordinate with property managers to prevent snow piles from blocking visibility.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Driveway and alley plowing with compact trucks and snow blowers</li>
      <li>Sidewalk shoveling for residential stoops and storefronts</li>
      <li>Calcium chloride and treated salt applications for fast melt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Lakeview service FAQs</h2>
    <details>
      <summary>Do you clear snow before rush hour?</summary>
      <p>
        Yes. We stage crews overnight so driveways, alleys, and sidewalks are clear before morning commuters hit the road or walk
        to the train.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Can you handle corner lots and long sidewalks?</summary>
      <p>
        Absolutely. Our teams assign extra shovelers to corner buildings to keep crosswalks and curb cuts accessible.
