    <h2>Lakeview snow crews on standby</h2>
    <p>
      We maintain townhouse alleys, condo entrances, and retail sidewalks along Belmont, Broadway, and Clark. Crews are familiar
      with meter parking restrictions and coordinate with property managers to prevent snow piles from blocking visibility.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Driveway and alley plowing with compact trucks and snow blowers</li>
      <li>Sidewalk shoveling for residential stoops and storefronts</li>
      <li>Calcium chloride and treated salt applications for fast melt</li>
    </ul>
