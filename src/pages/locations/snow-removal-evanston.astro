    <details>
      <summary>What snowfall depth triggers service?</summary>
      <p>
        Most seasonal plans trigger at two inches, with pre-salting when freezing rain is in the forecast. We can adjust depth to
        match village requirements or HOA bylaws.

    <details>
      <summary>Can you clear private alleys or shared drives?</summary>
      <p>
        Yes. We operate equipment sized for shared easements and coordinate with neighbors as needed to keep everyone moving.
