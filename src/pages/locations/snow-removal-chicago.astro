    <h2>Chicago crews ready for every winter pattern</h2>
    <p>
      From the lakefront to the northwest neighborhoods, we manage routes that account for varying snowfall bands and wind
      drifts. Our dispatchers monitor radar around the clock and adjust start times as systems approach the city.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Plow trucks and skid steers sized for urban driveways and alleys</li>
      <li>Hand crews for stoops, sidewalks, and storefront entries</li>
      <li>Eco-friendly de-icing blends that protect concrete and landscaping</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Chicago snow removal FAQs</h2>
    <details>
      <summary>How fast do you dispatch after the snow starts?</summary>
      <p>
        We aim to have crews on-site within two hours of trigger depth, often sooner when heavy accumulation is forecast. For
        overnight events, routes are staged before dawn to keep morning traffic moving.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Can you work with limited parking or tight alleys?</summary>
      <p>
        Yes. Our compact equipment and shovel teams are selected specifically for Chicago’s tighter lots, gangways, and shared
        drive spaces.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Do you offer on-demand pushes for smaller storms?</summary>
      <p>
        We provide one-time service when availability allows. Reach out through our <a href="/contact/">contact form</a> or call
        us for the fastest response during active weather.
