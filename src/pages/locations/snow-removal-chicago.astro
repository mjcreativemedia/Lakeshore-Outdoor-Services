    <h2>Chicago crews ready for every winter pattern</h2>
    <p>
      From Hyde Park to Rogers Park, we manage routes that account for varying snowfall bands and wind drifts. Our dispatchers
      monitor radar around the clock and adjust start times as systems approach the city.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Plow trucks and skid steers sized for urban driveways and alleys</li>
      <li>Hand crews for stoops, sidewalks, and storefront entries</li>
      <li>Eco-friendly de-icing blends that protect concrete and landscaping</li>
