    <h2>Prepared for Winnetkaâ€™s demanding winters</h2>
    <p>
      Lakefront winds, tree-lined streets, and long private drives require strategic snow management. We stage crews across the
      village to respond quickly as storms move inland from Lake Michigan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seasonal clients rely on us for repeated passes, snow relocation, and documentation needed for HOA boards and estate managers.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Equipment tailored to estate properties</h2>
    <p>
      Large estates and private schools benefit from loaders, skid steers, and sidewalk crews that keep garages, service courts,
      and athletic facilities accessible. We protect heated driveway systems, granite pavers, and decorative lighting from damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      For village streets and commuter parking, we coordinate with municipal schedules to clear curb cuts, train station lots, and
      pedestrian paths before sunrise.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Communication keeps everyone aligned</h2>
    <p>
      Each visit generates a digital report detailing snow totals, materials used, and follow-up recommendations. During extended
      storms, managers receive ETA updates and photos confirming that entrances, mail kiosks, and fire hydrants remain open.
