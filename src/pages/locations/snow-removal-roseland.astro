    <h2>Neighborhood routes designed for Roseland</h2>
    <p>
      We map every driveway, alley, and sidewalk around Fernwood Park, Palmer Park, and the nearby Pullman National Historical
      Park. Our crews navigate the one-way residential streets between Wentworth and State, coordinating with residents to move
      vehicles before storms hit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shovel teams focus on stoops, gangways, and ADA ramps so seniors, commuters, and students can reach CTA buses and the Metra
      Electric line without slipping.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Trusted support for community institutions</h2>
    <p>
      Roseland’s churches, schools, and social service centers require reliable access during weather emergencies. We stage
      equipment near 111th Street to keep Sunday services on schedule and ensure food pantry deliveries reach their loading docks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Digital service logs provide timestamps, photos, and material notes so facility managers can document compliance and budget
      for future seasons.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Continuous monitoring throughout each storm</h2>
    <p>
      Dispatchers watch Midway Airport radar, IDOT road sensors, and local alerts to time return visits. When the wind shifts off
      Lake Michigan and drifts form along Cottage Grove, we deploy additional crews from our South Side yard to reopen lanes and
      sidewalks quickly.
