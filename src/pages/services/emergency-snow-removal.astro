    <h2>Emergency snow removal FAQs</h2>
    <details>
      <summary>How fast can a crew arrive?</summary>
      <p>
        We target arrival within 90 minutes inside the city and North Shore, weather and road conditions permitting. We’ll
        confirm ETA when you call so you know exactly when help is coming.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>What triggers an emergency dispatch?</summary>
      <p>
        Emergencies include blocked driveways, stuck vehicles, disabled equipment, or accumulations beyond your contract’s
        trigger depth. When totals exceed agreements, we can add an extra pass to reopen access.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>How is pricing handled?</summary>
      <p>
        Emergency work is billed hourly with a two-hour minimum. We’ll review rates on the phone before dispatching so there are
        no surprises, and invoice digitally once the job is complete.
