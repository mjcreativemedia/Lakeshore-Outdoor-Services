    <h2>Ice dam removal that protects your roof</h2>
    <p>
      We use low-pressure steam to melt away ice dams safely. Our specialists arrive with heated hoses, roof access gear, and snow
      removal tools to prevent refreezing. You get a clean roof edge and dry ceilings within hours.

    <details>
      <summary>How fast can you get to my home?</summary>
      <p>
        During peak storms we prioritize active leaks and often arrive the same day. Evening and weekend dispatch is available for
        South Side and North Side homeowners.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Will steaming damage my shingles?</summary>
      <p>
        No. Steam melts the bond between ice and roofing materials without scraping. Our technicians maintain water flow to
        prevent refreezing on your eaves.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Do you clear snow before treating the ice dam?</summary>
      <p>
        Yes. We shovel critical roof sections and downspouts before steaming so runoff has a clear path away from your gutters
        and fascia.
