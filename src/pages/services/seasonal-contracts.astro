    <h2>Predictable coverage for unpredictable winters</h2>
    <p>
      Chicago winters swing from lake-effect dustings to blizzards that shut down Lake Shore Drive. Seasonal contracts guarantee
      you a crew no matter how the forecast evolves. We map every property before the first flake, identifying snow storage areas,
      slip hazards, and special requests like priority entrances or loading docks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contracts span November through April and include preseason site walks, route planning, and onboarding for building staff.
      Our dispatchers monitor O'Hare and Midway radar, plus shoreline sensors that track lake-effect bands moving into South Shore,
      Bronzeville, Pullman, and Evanston.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each client receives a custom storm plan showing start times, crew assignments, and escalation contacts. That means property
      managers and HOA boards know exactly who to call during overnight events.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Flexible triggers and communication</h2>
    <p>
      Seasonal programs are designed around your operations. Residential estates in Winnetka might request a one-inch trigger to
      keep heated driveways spotless, while Roseland churches prioritize accessibility for Sunday services. We can stage sidewalk
      teams to arrive ahead of plows so parishioners and employees reach entrances safely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Communication is constant: clients receive text or email alerts when storms are imminent, when crews depart, and when service
      is complete. Digital logs include snow totals, photos, and materials applied. If municipal plows push snow back onto your
      aprons, we add a return visit without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      For mixed-use developments, we coordinate with onsite engineers to keep loading docks open and to monitor rooftop drains.
      Our crews check catch basins, hydrants, and emergency exits to meet Chicago Fire Department compliance rules.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Budget confidence and proactive planning</h2>
    <p>
      Seasonal pricing spreads winter costs evenly across monthly invoices, helping condo associations and commercial landlords plan
      budgets. Multi-year agreements lock in labor and equipment, ensuring the same crew leads return each year. We also reserve
      backup equipment at our South Side and North Shore yards so we can respond to equipment failures without missing a beat.
    </p>
    <p>
      After winter, we debrief each route, noting opportunities for off-season grading or drainage improvements. Those insights help
      reduce ice buildup around ADA ramps, trash enclosures, and parking lot entrances before the next snowfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ready to secure coverage? Our team can review site plans, past service logs, and compliance notices to build a contract that
      keeps your Chicago property operating smoothly through the harshest winter stretches.
