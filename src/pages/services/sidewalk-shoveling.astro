    <h2>Hand crews dedicated to people-first pathways</h2>
    <p>
      Chicago ordinances require sidewalks cleared within hours of each snowfall. We build shoveling teams specifically for
      pedestrian areas—school zones, transit stops, senior housing, and storefront corridors. Crews rotate through Bronzeville,
      South Shore, Pullman, and Hyde Park during heavy events, focusing on corners where plows leave windrows and where residents
      need extra assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sidewalk leads coordinate with our plow dispatch center so driveways and walks finish simultaneously. That means customers
      can step from the curb onto a treated surface, and delivery drivers have a direct path to service doors and freight
      elevators.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Detailed attention for stairs, ramps, and entries</h2>
    <p>
      We use ergonomic shovels, snow blowers, and battery-powered brushes sized for Chicago brownstone stoops and limestone steps
      along Drexel Boulevard. Crews apply ice melt by hand along railings and tuck-in areas so thawing water doesn’t refreeze into
      slick patches. For busy CTA stations and apartment lobbies, we can stage attendants to maintain mats and mop up slush during
      peak hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our teams also support North Side business districts, clearing patios and multi-tenant entryways along Clark Street, Halsted,
      and Broadway. In Evanston, we keep University classrooms, research facilities, and student residences accessible even during
      finals week storms.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Pullman row homes and industrial corridors, we adapt workflows to historic brick sidewalks and loading docks where
      machinery cannot reach. Sanding is available for pavers or granite surfaces that require extra traction.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Communication that keeps you compliant</h2>
    <p>
      Each shoveling event ends with a digital report noting arrival times, weather conditions, and any obstructions we cleared.
      That documentation helps property managers respond to city inspectors or insurance adjusters. If we spot icy gutter
      discharge or damaged downspouts, we flag the issue so maintenance teams can intervene before the next storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also coordinate with building engineers to manage rooftop melt and basement stair drains. When lake-effect systems stall
      over the South Side, we deploy extra crews from our Calumet staging area to keep ADA ramps open at schools, churches, and
      community centers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seasonal clients receive text alerts when crews are en route and completion notices once surfaces are clear. Need on-demand
      help after volunteer shovelers fall behind? We offer emergency dispatch during prolonged storms, with crews ready to serve
      Bronzeville art corridors, Pullman National Historical Park, and the Evanston lakefront.
