      answer:
        "<p>We focus on residential driveways, small commercial lots, condo associations, and institutions that need consistent service on sidewalks and entries. Our crews adapt equipment to tight South Side alleys and North Shore carriage drives alike.</p>",

    {
      question: "How do you decide when to dispatch crews?",
      answer:
        "<p>We monitor multiple weather feeds and send alerts as lake-effect bands build. Routes launch once accumulation hits your chosen trigger depth, typically between one and two inches, with return visits for drifting or refreeze concerns.</p>",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I bundle shoveling and de-icing?",
      answer:
        "<p>Yes. Most seasonal plans include sidewalk shoveling teams paired with calibrated salt or calcium treatments. We tailor material blends to concrete age, pet traffic, and environmental goals.</p>",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer storm reporting?",
      answer:
        "<p>After each visit you receive a timestamped service log detailing start and finish times, crew notes, and photos when requested. These reports keep HOA boards and property managers aligned on winter maintenance.</p>",

      <li>Driveway and parking lot plowing with real-time storm alerts</li>
      <li>Sidewalk, stair, and entry shoveling with ice melt application</li>

    <h2>How our programs work</h2>
    <p>
      Seasonal clients receive weather monitoring, automatic dispatch at agreed trigger depths, and digital service logs after
      each visit. Need a one-off push? We offer per-event pricing when capacity allows.
