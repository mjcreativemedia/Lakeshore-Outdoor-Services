    <h2>Everything you need for a clear property</h2>
    <p>
      We combine plow trucks, shovel teams, and de-icing specialists to keep residential and small commercial sites open all
      winter. Routes are customized based on your trigger depth, surface materials, and hours of operation.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Driveway and parking lot plowing with real-time storm alerts</li>
      <li>Sidewalk, stair, and entry shoveling with ice melt application</li>
      <li>Loader and skid-steer support for tight spaces or heavy accumulation</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="details">
    <h2>How our programs work</h2>
    <p>
      Seasonal clients receive weather monitoring, automatic dispatch at agreed trigger depths, and digital service logs after
      each visit. Need a one-off push? We offer per-event pricing when capacity allows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ask about bundling roof snow clearing or <a href="/services/ice-dam-removal/">ice dam removal</a> with your plan so runoff
      stays controlled even during long freeze-thaw cycles.
