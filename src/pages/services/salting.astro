    <h2>Keep surfaces open during Chicago cold snaps</h2>
    <p>
      Lake-effect bursts and Arctic fronts can flash-freeze pavement within minutes. Our de-icing crews patrol city and suburban
      routes every time pavement temperatures dip toward the teens. We stage salt bins in Hyde Park alleys, load brine tanks near
      Bronzeville condo corridors, and coordinate with plow teams so each site stays accessible for residents and deliveries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every route starts with preseason calibration. We document square footage, identify shaded areas prone to black ice, and
      mark hazards like basement stairwells or retaining walls. When storms hit, that data guides our team so material is spread
      evenly without damaging masonry or landscaping.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Equipment sized for tight lots and busy corridors</h2>
    <p>
      Chicago’s mix of two-flats, courtyard buildings, and historic storefronts demands nimble equipment. Our operators run tailgate
      spreaders on half-ton trucks for alleys, walk-behind drop spreaders for narrow gangways, and ATV-mounted units for large
      apartment complexes. Liquid brine rigs sit on dispatch-ready trailers so we can pre-treat arterial routes before the morning
      commute.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the North Shore, we adapt coverage for brick pavers along Central Street, school campuses near Wilmette Avenue, and
      lakefront drives exposed to wind-driven spray. Operators document every pass with GPS and send service logs to HOA boards or
      property managers before sunrise.
    </p>
    <p>
      South Side routes focus on community corridors like Stony Island Avenue and 75th Street. We coordinate with local businesses
      so sidewalks stay clear for commuters heading to the Metra Electric or CTA Red Line stations.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Season-long monitoring prevents refreeze</h2>
    <p>
      Our meteorologists monitor National Weather Service briefings, Midway Airport readings, and shoreline temperature sensors to
      anticipate freeze-thaw cycles. After a storm, crews return for touch-up applications when meltwater flows back across
      driveways or when shaded walks along Drexel Boulevard retain slush. We also offer bucketed material for onsite staff so they
      can treat problem spots between scheduled visits.
    </p>
    <p>
      When temperatures plunge below zero, we switch to magnesium or calcium blends that remain active in extreme cold. These
      treatments are ideal for elevated entrances at hospitals, schools, and churches that cannot tolerate slick steps during
      weekend services or early classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Documentation is delivered after every call-out, including weather notes, product types, and before-and-after photos when
      requested. These records simplify insurance reporting and demonstrate due diligence for Chicago’s slip-and-fall ordinances.
